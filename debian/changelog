bubblewrap (0.1.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use Perl rather than shell script for the autopkgtest test cases.
    This avoids needing the uncommon bats package, or writing shell
    scripts.

bubblewrap (0.1.8-1) experimental; urgency=medium

    - Stop trying to run tests/test-basic.sh, it no longer exists
    - Build-depend on python, one test now needs it
  * Build-depend on docbook-xml for the documentation DTD
  * Move to debhelper compat level 10

bubblewrap (0.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/p/Make-the-call-to-setsid-optional-with-new-session.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to make the setsid() that addresses
    CVE-2017-5226 optional, because it breaks interactive shells.
    Users of bubblewrap to confine untrusted programs should either
    add --new-session to the bwrap command line, or prevent the
    TIOCSTI ioctl with a seccomp filter instead (as Flatpak does).
    - d/control: add Breaks on versions of Flatpak that did not
      load the necessary seccomp filter to prevent CVE-2017-5226
  * d/p/demos-bubblewrap-shell.sh-Unshare-all-namespaces.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to improve example code
  * d/p/Call-setsid-and-setexeccon-befor-forking-the-init-monitor.patch,
    d/p/Install-seccomp-filter-at-the-very-end.patch:
    Add patches from upstream to re-order initialization. This means
    the seccomp filter is no longer required to account for syscalls that
    are made by bwrap itself.
  * d/p/Add-unshare-all-and-share-net.patch:
    Add patch from upstream introducing new command line options
    --unshare-all and --share-net, for a more whitelist-based approach
    to sharing namespaces with the parent.

bubblewrap (0.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release

    to SIGCHLD handling and documentation, and improved hardening
    against being able to obtain capabilities
  * debian/bubblewrap.examples: install upstream examples

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Jan 2017 22:18:09 +0000

bubblewrap (0.1.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * d/p/Call-setsid-before-executing-sandboxed-code-CVE-2017-5226.patch:
    Call setsid() before executing sandboxed code, preventing a
    sandboxed executable invoked with a controlling terminal (for
    example in Flatpak) from escalating its privileges by injecting
    keypresses into the controlling terminal with the TIOCSTI
    ioctl. (Closes: #850702; CVE-2017-5226)
  * d/control: remove Maintainer status from Laszlo Boszormenyi at his
    request. Add him to Uploaders instead, and hand the package over
    to the Utopia Maintenance Team (the same as OSTree and Flatpak).

bubblewrap (0.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/tests/*: only run tests on a real or virtual machine, not in a
    container. bubblewrap is effectively already a container, and
    nesting containers doesn't work particularly well.
    Unfortunately this means the tests won't work on ci.debian.net,
    which uses LXC.

    d/p/Adapt-tests-so-they-can-be-run-against-installed-binaries.patch,
    d/p/Fix-incorrect-nesting-of-backticks-when-finding-a-FUSE-mo.patch:
    improve the upstream tests
  * d/tests/upstream: run the upstream tests as autopkgtests
  * d/rules: Do not enable setuid mode at configure time. If we do, we
    can't run the build-time tests, and it no longer makes any difference
    to the actual code. Make the executable setuid via Debian packaging
    instead.

bubblewrap (0.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #826358).

  [ Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org> ]
  * debian/copyright: correct package name and source (closes: #824969)
  * debian/control: make the whole package Linux-only. Like Flatpak, this
    package is inherently non-portable.
  * Move from Section: web to Section: admin
  * Increase Priority to optional, because this tool is likely to be
    depended on by gnome-software (via Flatpak) in future
  * Add some simple autopkgtests, including one for bug 71 (closes: #824968)
